# ct-gossiper

EXAMPLE OF HOW TO USE -

the gossip server uses GLOG so check here -> https://godoc.org/github.com/golang/glog for the GLOG options

open 4 terminals (Term 1 - Term 4)
in Term 1 type
  > server.exe -log_dir=./log 1000 2000 3000 

This will create a gossip server at http://localhost:1000, that will gossip to servers at http://localhost:2000, and http://localhost:3000
in Term 2 type
  > server.exe -log_dir=./log 2000 1000 3000 

in Term 3 type
  > server.exe -log_dir=./log 3000 1000 2000 

Now all 3 servers are running

In Term 4 navagate to /testing and type
  > test.exe -log_dir=./log 1000 0 abc

This will make a post request to http://localhost:1000/gossip with a dummy CTData struct with a timestamp of 0, and a blob of [97, 98, 99]

All three servers now know about is CTData struct

If you type
  > test.exe 1000 0 abc

into Term 4 again you will get a message saying that it is a duplicate message

Now type 
  > test.exe 1000 0 abcd

into Term 4

and a PoM will be generated by the server at http://localhost:1000, and sent to http://localhost:2000, and http://localhost:3000
